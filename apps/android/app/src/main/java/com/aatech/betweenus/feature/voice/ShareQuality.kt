/**
 * How much of a screen, and how many bits, a phone sends.
 *
 * The port of the numbers in `apps/desktop/src/services/share-quality.ts`, and
 * the reason they exist is the same: an out-of-the-box WebRTC share is 15 fps
 * at about 3 Mbps, which is a slideshow of a smear. Android's defaults were
 * worse still - the capture was pinned at 1280x720 at 15 fps with no encoding
 * ceiling at all, so a 1080p phone sent a downscaled, slow, thin picture and
 * there was nothing on the receiving end that could put back what was never
 * sent.
 *
 * The ceiling is a ceiling, not a target. A still screen spends a fraction of
 * it and congestion control lowers it the moment the link objects; setting it
 * too high costs nothing on a link that cannot carry it, and setting it too low
 * is a permanently soft picture.
 *
 * The desktop's `detail` profile is what this mirrors: resolution preserved,
 * frames sacrificed, because a share is usually something being read.
 *
 * ponytail: one profile, not the desktop's detail/motion pair. The picker that
 * chooses between them is a desktop affordance and a phone shares its own
 * screen, which is text far more often than it is film. The second profile is
 * the upgrade if anybody wants it.
